# Typing Practice App

## Overview
🚀 The Typing Practice App is designed to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy by providing a timed practice session with random words.

## Features
- Display of a word for the user to type within a specified time interval.
- ⏱ Stopwatch to show the time remaining in the practice session.
- Dynamic button to start, stop, and restart the practice session.
- 📊 Calculation and display of average Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy after each session.

## Usage
1. 🚀 Run the app.
2. Select the practice duration (15, 30, or 60 seconds).
3. Click the "Start Practice" button to begin the session.
4. Type the displayed word within the time limit.
5. The app will dynamically change the button to "Stop Practice" during the session.
6. After the session, statistics such as average WPM and accuracy will be displayed.

## Further Work
- Enhance the word list by incorporating the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) corpus for a larger and diverse set of words.
- 🔄 Implement a feature to allow the user to start a new session or restart the current session after clicking the "Stop Practice" button.
